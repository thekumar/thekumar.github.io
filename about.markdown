- 👋 Hi, I’m Vijay, an Engineer. I design and build stuff... mainly through code. There are exceptions.
  - I also used to be a [Googler](https://docs.google.com), [Dropboxer](https://paper.dropbox.com), [Amazonian](https://aws.amazon.com), and most recently, a [Skiffer](https://www.skiff.com).
- 👀 I’m interested in Security/Privacy, Collaboration @ Scale using OT and CRDTs, Data Science, and Deep Learning. I'm motivated by bringing people and communities together to create something... and thus I am interested in building collaborative tools, streamlining payments/economic activity, and improving access to healthcare through applied data science. Hit me up if there is a shared interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Large Language Models and Sequence Models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a distributed serverless sync API, and on building Datayaki, a data analytics tool that is so easy your mother could use it.
- 📫 How to reach me: @thekumar on twitter.
- 🏕️🥾🚴🏽🚵🏼🏃🏽🏂✈️, My other interests.

This site is still under construction (and will always be), but mainly serves as my blogging home.
