<p>First things first! Before getting started with any software development project, you need to have certain basic necessities taken care of.</p>
<p>First - <strong>Version Control Software</strong>! The ability to keep track of changes made to code, and the ability to go back to any version is of utmost importance to any software engineering project.<br/>Second - A <strong>wiki</strong> to track design and progress is also necessary. Helps make collaborating easy (of course, at the end of this project, my notes app will replace the wiki).</p>
<p>In my setup, I use Subversion &amp; Mediawiki. Reasons? Just personal preference. Some of you may like to use git, or cvs. I chose Subversion because it comes pre-installed with MacOS, and also because I have prior experience using it for work. And I chose Mediawiki, because Wikipedia runs on it, and because its setup is plain &amp; simple.</p>
<p>I will get into more details about how to setup a SVN Repository, and a mediawiki server in later posts. For now let me just leave with saying that these are absolute essentials.</p>
