<p>The last time I made a blog post, I was working on my Arduino project as part of my grand plan of building 12 vastly different things in the span of 12 months, each of which will force me to learn something new each month. And, just when it was beginning to progress forward, something big happened and my biggest project of the year took over&hellip; Moving to New York for a job at Google NYC. And along with it, my Arduino project got put on hold. Quite literally, in storage, along with most other tools I could use for creative purposes. Though the siege will soon be over when I move into my own apartment next month, I can’t wait to get all my stuff back.</p><p>All was not lost however, as I did get to work on a couple of software projects that were well beyond my area of expertise. I got to learn Machine Learning with Tensor Flow, and built a couple of domain-specific content recommendation systems using Hadoop MR. And on top of that, I definitely took advantage of my honeymoon period here at Google, and started learning as much random tech as possible while my actual responsibilities at work are still minimal.</p><p>Still, they don’t show the results that I had hoped for when I started on my grand goal of 12 in 12. So, lets focus on something that has a high chance of being on track this year&hellip;</p><p><b>Health!</b></p><p>My 12-month goal on the health front was to lose 20+lbs to get into my doctor-recommended BMI range. And, I may have gone a bit too crazy with it by signing up for a bit too much :) May be way too much&hellip; And now it’s time to train.</p><p>End of July, I’m running the <b>first half of the SF Marathon!</b> EZPZ!</p><figure data-orig-width="904" data-orig-height="905" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/313d1ff97b1feaa25af1fdf794fb13ec/tumblr_inline_o3rev7u6lg1rl1exj_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="904" data-orig-height="905"/></figure><p>A month later, I’m <b>climbing Kilimanjaro</b> the last week of August!
