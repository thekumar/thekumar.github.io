<p>It took me over a week to figure it out. But, finally&hellip; it works without crashing on me! (At least, not for the wrong reasons)</p>
<p>Now, all that I have left is to hook up the in-app unlock flow, and it should be good to go. All you folks that signed up for testflight, expect a build by Thursday ;)</p>
<p>In other news&hellip;</p>
<p>I watched Elon Musk&rsquo;s D11 interview last week, and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with Kara Swisher&rsquo;s statement about Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of big minds chasing small ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yep! Sorry for sounding like a bit of a douche, but I think my projects and I stand as perfect examples for that quote. Those who know me well could probably tell that I&rsquo;m already bored with this app, even though it&rsquo;s probably the coolest video app ever ;) Okay&hellip; &ldquo;Action Camera&rdquo; beats it in coolness. But, at the end of the day (or early 3am in the morning), it&rsquo;s not helping any bit in taking humanity to a better state of existence.</p>
<p>I should probably stop being Debbie downer, and get some sleep (-_-)</p>
