<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, they are closing shop at Posterous at the end of the month. So,Â I just moved my blog to its new home at tumblr, and it couldn&rsquo;t have been any simpler, thanks to this awesome service Justmigrate.com. Yes, they did mess up the migration in minor ways by trying to do too much. Like, creating a Photo post, instead of Text post, if my blog post had only one picture in it, and messing up the title and text formatting in the process. But, it was just a minor annoyance, as I only had to deal with 2 of those posts.</p>
<p>Anyway, now I gotta work on customizing the theme to make it look just like my website. And, while we are at it, I&rsquo;m also migrating my website (and Fotoyaki.com along with a few other things I&rsquo;ve been working on) over from godaddy on to AWS. Setting up hosting on S3 was a breeze. Only thing left is for me to change the CNAME entries for my domains to point to my S3 buckets.</p>
