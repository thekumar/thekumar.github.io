<p>A quick update on where things are with me and the project.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Scrolling like Butter&rdquo; - Check!</strong></p>
<p>After spending sleepless nights and countless hours at coffee shops (I spent so much time at Cafe La Vie, that Dirty Chai is no longer just my drink&hellip; it&rsquo;s my nickname :/), I have finally gotten the smooth scrolling effect selector to work. For the longest time, I was stuck trying to figure out how this <em>CADisplayLink</em> object worked. I knew it contained the secret sauce for getting my UI to work my way, but there is this whole new world of <em>NSRunLoops</em> that I needed to understand first, and it wasn&rsquo;t making much sense&hellip; until I stumbled across this ADC Video last night. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/itunes/?destination=adc.apple.com.16351493766" title="Enhancing UX with UIScrollView">Enhancing UX with UIScrollView</a>. Suddenly, everything became clear. And, after yet another night of working till 5am and getting 3 hours of sleep, I got it to work!</p>
<p>No screenshots to share yet, as its still just as ugly as the prototype. Also, a screenshot wouldn&rsquo;t suffice to showcase the smoothness of the scrolling. But I&rsquo;m happy that it&rsquo;s finally working after all that time spent in between coffee breaks, and attending phone interviews in the quiet bathroom corridors of malls. Those bathroom corridors are nice quiet spots&hellip; until the cleaning lady shows up with her cart. Then, they turn into the loudest echo chambers of rolling thunder. Anyway, speaking of phone interviews&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>My next pay-Check!</strong></p>
<p>Interviewing has been going great so far. In fact, a bit too good that I had to take a pause yesterday to make sure that I&rsquo;m not rushing into this. I was chatting with an ex-Microsoft buddy, and he felt I might be making brash decisions due to my short term financial situation. And I could relate to what he was talking about. A job should be a lot more than just your next paycheck. My ideal job is one where I get paid for the skills and experience that I bring to the table, and one where I get a chance to learn new stuff that I wouldn&rsquo;t get to learn/experience elsewhere. And all the companies that I&rsquo;m currently interviewing with, each bring their own sets of pros and cons. Startup vs. Well established vs. Big scale problems vs. Personal growth opportunities vs. Commute. It&rsquo;s a tough choice!</p>
<p>Anyway, he felt that I should actually take a break from the job search, and focus on building my mobile apps if possible&hellip; But, I have a different take on mobile apps. They are projects. Not companies.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went through a bunch of tech interviews in the last two weeks, and am at different stages of the process with different companies&hellip; ranging from scheduled on-sites, to verbal job offers. It was a busy interview schedule&hellip; So much so that I actually ended up taking a phone screen in between two interviewers at an on-site. (It&rsquo;s not my fault they went over the scheduled time.)Â So, my next paycheck&hellip; it&rsquo;s looking good, but no official word on it yet.</p>
<p>Last, but not least&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Pull-Up - Check!</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to do an unassisted pull-up (chin-up) in my lifetime&hellip; until yesterday :) Got to do one, albeit barely. But, it still counts!</p>
<p>Testing 1 2 3&hellip; Mic Check!</p>
