<p>This is the first post on TechSmack, and since this blog is supposed to get pretty detailed about my trials in tech&hellip; let me first define a product scope, around which most of my work, and thus the content of this blog, will stay focused.</p>
<p>I wanna build an app on the cloud (Translation, a web-app). And a pretty simple one at that&hellip; a web based Note-taking app a la OneNote, except, only simpler. I love using my Mac for everything except taking notes and scribbling my thoughts. Because, I&rsquo;ve gotten used to the simplicity of MS OneNote. OneNote is one of the few software marvels from Microsoft, and it still bewilders me to think that there is no valid alternative for it available on the Mac/iOS platform. So, initially I thought of building a native iPhone/iPad app. But, HTML5 support is gaining traction on all platforms. So, I&rsquo;ve decided to create a web-app for it (with client side data caching for offline use).</p>
<p>So there it is! This is what I&rsquo;m gonna build. A <strong>Note-taking app</strong> (written in HTML5) that resides on the cloud, but allows for offline editing. Let&rsquo;s go build it!</p>
