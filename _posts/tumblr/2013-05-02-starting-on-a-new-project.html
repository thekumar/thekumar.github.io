<p>So, things have been a bit uncertain at work, as we&rsquo;re trying out different things to gain traction for our product. There are many reasons why we haven&rsquo;t been able to find as big of a user base as we wish&hellip; starting with, not having an open sign up :) But, I&rsquo;ll save those reasons for a different post. At the end of the day, I work at a startup. And along with the thrill &amp; benefits of working in a small team, comes the risks of the idea/product not making it.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re kinda at the stage where we go big or go home, and I really hope we &ldquo;Go Big&rdquo;, and not go home :) Anyway, these uncertain times are usually when I get most creative with my side projects and start-up ideas. My mind started going through all the big ideas that have been brewing - An open ad server on the cloud; A location based gaming framework with local ads; A project management tool on the cloud for software companies that simplifies scrum; An app that vastly improves on the UX for music consumption on iOS devices; A game based on broken-picture-telephone&hellip; And, after a bit of pondering on my BART ride back to my parents, my mind settled on something totally out of the blue.</p>
<p>An iPhone/iPad video app. I can&rsquo;t say much about it, but I promise to keep this blog updated on its development. Here&rsquo;s what I can say&hellip;</p>
<ol><li>The app is math intensive (which all works out just fine in my mind. At least, it all did on the BART ride)</li>
<li>I just started reading up on OpenCV and GPU accelerated programming.</li>
<li>It will blow your mind ;)</li>
</ol><p>I am gonna be busy at least until the end of May to finish up our current project. If that is the case, then I expect to have the app on the marketplace by July. A month seems like a good amount of time to get it done, if I get to work on it full-time evenings.</p>
