<p>I realize I haven&rsquo;t made blog posts as regularly as I had originally intended to. So, to catchup on lost time, here are some quick highlights.</p>
<p>I finished my pricing experiment with Fotoyaki, and yes, $1.99 is a better price point than $0.99&hellip; at least for an app like Fotoyaki. I might need to try the same experiment on other apps to see if the conclusion stands ground across all genres of apps. I will make another post that has more details on the numbers.</p>
<p>After experimenting with the price points, and being satisfied with whatever meager sales data I collected, I decided to make Fotoyaki free again as I had originally intended. Within a week of making it free, the download count went from ≈350K total to over 500K. 130K on a single day after the spanish site appgratuit.es picked up the price drop, and shot the app to #1 overall app in Spain with 97K+ downloads on a single day. The App currently has over 650K downloads, with daily count anywhere between 500 and 1200.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough Fotoyaki talk. I, along with a couple of buddies tried to start a co-creative mobile app development community a la quirky.com. To check the viability of the idea, we tried to do things in a micro scale, by setting up a wordpress blog, and using polldaddy for feedback. You can check it out at <a href="http://ripll.wordpress.com">http://ripll.wordpress.com</a>. How did the viability study go? Well, I&rsquo;ll talk about that in more detail in a subsequent post as well, but the gist of it is that we are not pursuing that idea. We are however building the app, which has got some cool design elements to it&hellip; which I will also make a future blog post about. So many promises being made here&hellip; This blog is set up for failure :)</p>
<p>And to save the biggest update for the last&hellip; I am leaving mobclix tomorrow, and joining Bread Labs (<a href="http://bre.ad">http://bre.ad</a>) next month. I&rsquo;m SUPER EXCITED about it, and hoping something awesome gets made there!!! Going to India for 2 weeks before I start there march 1st&hellip; and super excited about that as well.</p>
<p>Okay, this post is almost done&hellip; but, there is&hellip;</p>
