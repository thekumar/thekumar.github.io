<p>Standing desks are all the rave these days, and being a person who keeps up to date with current trends, I decided to make one for myself. Did I mention DIY projects are also considered trendy?Just kidding.</p>
<p>There is a lot of science to support the theory that Standing Desks can help you maintain proper back posture. Also, there are studies that suggest sitting for long periods of time can be bad for your health, which is what we software engineers do all day long in front of a computer. And being a person that can’t sit up straight, and one that slouches all the time on the chair, those studies don’t need any more validation or peer reviews to convince me to “try” standing. I say “try”, because there is also a lot of science against standing as well (vericose veins?), and as I have never done it before, I am not sure if I will actually like it.</p>
<p>Luckily, thanks to <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">Colin Nederkoorn’s blog post</a>, trying just became easy and cheap! $22 cheap to be exact. Well, I made a few minor modifications to his DIY recipe, and was able to fit in an additional side table for a mere $5 more.</p>
<p>Here’s what I used:</p>
<ul><li>2 x <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/#/80104268">LACK side table</a> (Premium Color - Black/Brown): $9.99 ea. = $19.98</li>
<li> 2 x <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80142067/#/30167461">EKBY STÖDIS</a> Bracket: 50¢ ea. = $1.00</li>
<li> 1 x <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90167477/">EKBY VIKTOR</a> Shelf: $5.99 ea. = $5.99</li>
<li>Wood Screws: Extras laying around = $0.00</li>
</ul><p>Total Cost: $26.97</p>
<p>I found the cheaper shelf brackets to work just as well as the large wooden ones Colin’s recipe recommends. They seem to be just as sturdy, and actually result in a cleaner look that’s aesthetically more pleasing, with the brackets hidden flush under the shelf. I also chose to spend 2 extra bucks per LACK table to avoid the plasticky feel the cheaper glossy ones gave. Also, our desks at work are metallic, so I decided to stick some magnetic tape to the bottom of the LACK tables’ legs, so that they don’t slide around as easily.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s my build of the $22 standing desk adding character to our workplace, and it cost me just $27 with upgrades! Hopefully, others at bre.ad approve it ;)</p>
