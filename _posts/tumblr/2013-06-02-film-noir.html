<p>So, I finally got an official job offer from Shutterfly, and will be joining them soon, starting on the 17th of June :) Until then, I&rsquo;ve got all engines rolling full-steam on my video app! I&rsquo;ve been working full-time (overtime?) on it for the past couple of days, and have made major strides in development.</p>
<p>Stuff that got done in the last 2 days:</p>
<ul><li>Smooth scrolling of my effect selector is now even smoother.</li>
<li>Fixed the &ldquo;sketch&rdquo; filter algorithm to use adaptive threshold instead of Canny for detecting edges in all kinds of lighting.</li>
<li>Added a new &ldquo;Ink&rdquo; mode. Similar to sketch, but is simpler and cleaner. Black/Gray/White ink fills.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Noir&rdquo; filter is now truly unique to my app. It&rsquo;s not just another B&amp;W filter with a hipster name. It will now actually make her red lipstick stand out. (Or anything else that&rsquo;s red&hellip; like a baboon&rsquo;s arse). Anyway, this was inspired by Schindler&rsquo;s List&hellip; Just wanted y'all to know where my inspiration for that filter came from.</li>
<li>Worked on another filter for Color sketches&hellip; Not exactly there yet. Might have to save this one for later.</li>
<li>Icon designs &amp; Button graphics.</li>
<li>Figured out how to pause and resume recording a movie, and just finished coding it :) This was my biggest worry near the end of the project&hellip; but it was a few simple lines that I needed to add to GPUImage library to enhance its functionality. I will contribute this back to the open source community once I get it tested. It&rsquo;s the least I could do to give back to the awesome library that made all of this possible in the first place.</li>
</ul><p>What&rsquo;s left to do:</p>
<ul><li>Tweak &amp; refine the UI. Especially add depth using drop shadows.</li>
<li>Hookup the record/pause/resume/stop buttons to call the proper actions.</li>
<li>Figure out pricing strategy + build In-app purchase flow for freemium model.</li>
<li>Build out the basic free filters: Original and Black&amp;White</li>
<li>Build out some additional filters: Simple instagram looking ones&hellip; and some that kinda have that 70s&rsquo; sexploitation film look.</li>
<li>I want to add a simple way to customize each effect. For example, changing Noir filter to make green the pass-through color instead of red, or a slider to adjust the levels in the Ink filter. I already have an idea of how the UI would behave&hellip; WARNING! Feature Creep!!!</li>
<li>Add Flurry instrumentation to track feature usage.</li>
<li>Put some thought into building a Share Flow in the future.</li>
</ul><p>Anyway&hellip; here&rsquo;s another screenshot showing the improvements to &ldquo;Sketch,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Noir&rdquo; filter. And it&rsquo;s now an hour past the time that screenshot was taken. Goodnight!</p>
