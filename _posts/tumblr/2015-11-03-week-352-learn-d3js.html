<p>I started on my first weekly commitment as planned, but “feature creep” has extended the scope of that project well beyond 2 weeks, and I’m still working on it :/ However, I got to cross off another goal I had for this year in week 2, though not by my own choice. I got to volunteer with kids through <a href="http://www.keensanfrancisco.org">KEEN San Francisco</a> for a friend’s birthday. It was kinda confusing in the beginning, not knowing how to act around slightly challenged kids, but pretty soon I settled comfortably in my role as a horse pulling kids on a cart and running around the gym while they yelled “Giddy-up horsey! Faster!!!” I’m definitely going back to volunteer again.</p><p>Also, I got to squeeze in a business/pleasure (literally!) Halloween trip to NYC on top of that. I started the night as Indian Jones a.k.a Hindi&hellip; but then, had to attend to a production issue call from our NOC :/</p><p>What can I say, Indy hates Snakes&hellip;</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="720"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3c4fdf11e6b2cf95968f781eff6f5e7d/tumblr_inline_nx9p3rysec1rl1exj_540.jpg" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="720"/></figure><p>&hellip; and Hindi hates Bugs!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="640" data-orig-width="852"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/345cef754e47e7cc49713e41a364111c/tumblr_inline_nx9p3rCZxd1rl1exj_540.jpg" data-orig-height="640" data-orig-width="852"/></figure><p>Anyway, For week 3, my goal is to:</p><ol><li>Finish what I started in week 1 (I’m almost done with it!); and<br/></li><li>Learn D3.js and generate at least a simple interactive chart. May be a simple color wheel.<br/></li></ol>
