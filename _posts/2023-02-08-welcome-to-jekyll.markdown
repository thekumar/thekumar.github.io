I'm moving my blog from Tumblr to Jekyll/Github Pages. Why?

1. Tumblr stopped Javascript support a while back, and had slowly been removing more and more site customizations I had in place. Seriously, checkout the [D3 Demo][demo-post] here and compare it to my [tumblr hosted post][tumblr-post].
2. Jekyll is in line with the static blog generator pattern I wanted to use for migrating my blog over.
3. Github Pages makes deploying changes as easy as updating my local jekyll server and pushing changes to the repo.
4. Focus on blogging vs. deploying and setting permissions on S3.
5. I'm using `git` everyday anyway.

This is gonna be my new blogging home moving forward.
